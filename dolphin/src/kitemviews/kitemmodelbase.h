 * @brief Base class for model implementations used by KItemListView and KItemListController.
 *
 * A item-model consists of a variable number of items. The number of items
 * is given by KItemModelBase::count(). The data of an item is accessed by a unique index
 * with KItemModelBase::data(). The indexes are integer-values counting from 0 to the
 * KItemModelBase::count() - 1.
 *
 * One item consists of a variable number of role/value-pairs.
 *
 * A model can optionally provide sorting- and grouping-capabilities.
 *
 * Also optionally it is possible to provide a tree of items by implementing the methods
 * setExpanded(), isExpanded() and isExpandable().
