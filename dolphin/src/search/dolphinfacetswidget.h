 * real facets-implementation yet: There have been
 * some Dolphin specific user-interface and interaction
 * issues since 4.6 by embedding the Nepomuk facet-widget
 * into a QDockWidget (this is unrelated to the
 * Nepomuk facet-widget itself). Now in combination
 * with the search-shortcuts in the Places Panel some
 * existing issues turned into real showstoppers.
 *
 * So the longterm plan is to use the Nepomuk facets
 * again as soon as possible.
