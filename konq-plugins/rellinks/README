What is Konq Rellinks ?
=======================

Konq Rellinks is an add-on for Konqueror, the official KDE browser. 

It allows you to access the relations defined in the header of the document. These relations can be links to other versions of the document, RSS backend, search page, copyright informations,.... For more informations about this, see "The 'link'-Element in (X)HTML" at http://www.subotnik.net/html/link. 

The look of the Rellinks add-on is similar to the "Site Navigation Toolbar" of the Mozilla browser (not Mozilla Firebird).
