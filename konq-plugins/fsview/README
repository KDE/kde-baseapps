FSView is a tool for showing disc utilization in a graphical form, much
like the UNIX command 'du'. The visualisation type choosen is a treemap.
Treemaps allow for showing metrics of objects in nested structures, like
sizes of files and directories on your hard disc, where the the size of
directories is defined to be the sum of the size of its children.
Each object is represented by a rectangle which area is proportional to
its metric. The metric must have the property that the sum of the
children's metric of some object is equal or smaller than the objects
metric. This holds true for the file/directory sizes in the use case of
FSView.

It's provided both as a Konqueror KPart plugin for the mime type
inode/directory, and a standalone executable.

This was meant as a small test application and usage tutorial for
the TreeMap widget developed within KCachegrind. As it's quite cool
and small, it is now provided as a Konqueror addon in KDE.

For a full featured graphical 'du', see KDirStat. It's quite similar
to FSView, but allows for lot of cleanup actions.

Happy space hunting,
Josef
